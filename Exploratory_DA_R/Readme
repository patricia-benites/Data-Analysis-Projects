This project is part of the Data Analyst Nanodegree Program at Udacity.
I chose a Red Wine Quality dataset to explore. In the project, I investigate relationships between variables and make plots using R.
The Rmd file contains the code, the Html and pdf files contain the whole report, and the png files contain the plots.
