# Exploratory Data Analysis in R

    This project is part of the Data Analyst Nanodegree Program at Udacity.

    I chose a Red Wine Quality dataset to explore. In the project, I investigate relationships between variables and make plots using R.
    The Rmd file contains the code, the Html file contains the whole report, and the png files contain the plots.

    Summary
    • Developed exploratory data analysis in R examining descriptive statistics as well as histograms 
    • Executed bivariate and multivariate analysis using scatterplots, boxplots, correlation and linear regression 
    • Findings: The level of Alcohol and Sulphates have the greatest influence on the quality of the wine

    Data
    The data is available for research and the details are described in the paper:
