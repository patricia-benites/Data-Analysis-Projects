# Titanic Dataset Investigation using Python

    This project is part of the Data Analyst Nanodegree Program at Udacity.
    The code was written in Python. The data is from the Titanic dataset.
    The Html file contains the code and the analysis. I also included an md file which contains the code and png files containing the graphs.

    Summary
    • Posed a question about a dataset, then used NumPy and Pandas to answer that question based on the data 
    • Elaborated statistical analysis as conditional probability and logistic regression using Python 
    • Findings: The factors that most matters in the probability of surviving are the passenger gender and class
