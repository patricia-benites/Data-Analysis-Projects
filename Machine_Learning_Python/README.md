# Fraud Identification using Machine Learning

This project is part of the Data Analyst Nanodegree Program at Udacity.

The code was written in Python. The data contains public Enron financial and email data
The poi_id.py file contains the code in Python. In the final section, it dumps the classifier, the dataset and the final feature list to three files, respectively, my_classifier.pkl, my_dataset.pkl, and my_feature_list.pkl. You can use the tester.py file to test the precision and recall of the model and it will use these three files as input.
The feature_format.py file contains some important functions used in the poi_id.py.
There is a report explaining all the steps to build this classifier, all the algorithms tested, the feature selection method, etc. It is in the Machine_Learning_Project.pdf file.

    Some of the skills learned in this project are:
    Python
    scikit-learn
    machine learning
    natural language processing
    feature selection
    verifying machine learning performance

    Summary
    •	Created a machine learning algorithm to identify fraud using public Enron financial and email data
    •	Findings: The four key features to identify which Enron employees are more likely to have committed fraud are: exercised stock options, total stock value, bonus and salary.
