    "    \n",
    " - **Problematic street names: **Instead of Avenue, Street, Road, the street name is a number or an anormal character, like #105, #155, 122°29'07.1;\n",
    " - **Problematic city names: **Instead of San Francisco, or other city, the city name is a number, like 11720, 155, 157;   \n",
    " - **Zip Code: **probably wrong zip codes, like 515, 1087, 2952, since the most common zip code contains 5 digits and it starts with 94;  \n",
    " - **State name: **Some tags have the state name as a number, like 1463-1465, instead of CA;    \n",
    " - **\"node\" tags: ** Some \"node\" tags do not have user and uid field; \n",
    "\n",
    "The problems I was sure that were a typo, I corrected before saving the information in the csv file, inside the shape_element function. So, I wrote some fuctions (update_zip_code, update_name, update_city, update_state and update_country) in order to correct the fields.\n",
    "The \"nodes\" tags which doesn´t have user, uid or other field, I did not save in the csv file. The problematic zip codes with less than 5 digits were excluded. However, if the zip code had more than 5 digits, like 94045-0809, only the first 5 digits were kept. "
