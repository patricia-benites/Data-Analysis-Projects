# Data Visualization in Tableau

This project is part of the Data Analyst Nanodegree Program at Udacity.

    It uses the Loan Data from Prosper dataset which contains information about 113,937 loans with 81 variables.
    In the project, I investigate relationships between variables and make plots using Tableau.
    The twbx file contains the variables and plots, the Prosper_Loan_Data_Variables pdf file contains the description of the variables, and the Data_Visualization_Project pdf file contains a report.
    The project file can also be downloaded in the link: https://public.tableau.com/profile/patricia.benites#!/vizhome/Nanodegree_Final_Project/EconomicPerspective

    Summary
    • Created a data visualization using Tableau that highlights loan patterns during the sub-prime crisis
    • Evaluated data from 2006 to 2014 using bar and line graphs. Created two dashboards and a story to explain all the information
    • Findings: the average loan amount decreased in 2008 and returned to 2007 values only in 2012. Also in 2008, borrower's interest rate started to rise and only came back to that range in 2014
